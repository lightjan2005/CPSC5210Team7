# CPSC5210Team7
This is a project to write unit test to a basketball program
The game is simply a text-based basketball simulation. There are numbers associated with different shot types and defense formations. The user enters one of these numbers when prompted for a shot type or defense formation. This allows the game to progress such that the set probabilities are used to determine the outcome of the user having chosen a certain shot type. This project is in Python.

There are four types of shots:

Long Jump Shot (30ft)

Short Jump Shot (15ft)

Lay Up

Set Shot


Both teams use the same defense, but you may call it:

Enter (6): Press

Enter (6.5): Man-to-man

Enter (7): Zone

Enter (7.5): None


To change defense, type "0" as your next shot.

Steps to run the tests-
